My solutions to the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021), written in TypeScript for Node.js.

I started this AoC for the purpose of learning TS, so I had *zero* experience with it prior to this. In other words, don't expect the code to be in well-written, idiomatic TypeScript.  
I also had near-zero experience with JavaScript prior to this.
